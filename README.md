# JS-CLOUDFRAMEWORK

This Javascript Framework has been developed to simplify many of the operation required for WebApps.

There are in the market dozens of different frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, JQuery etc.. But normally they require to include a lot of libraries, plugins, and the style of programming is quite different depending the of the philosophy.

JS-CLOUDFRAME does not try to replace any of other frameworks, just in one file you will have the power to accomplish complex features through the Core class and it push you to follow a methodology.
.
JS-CLOUDFRAMEWORK is a very straight-forward solutions as the result to develop hundred of projects and it is ready to interact with CloudFramework API services.
